/**
 * A field's type can be either an object type OR a scalar type.
 * A scalar type is a primitive (like ID, String, Boolean, or Int) that resolves to a single value. In addition to
 * GraphQL's built-in scalar types, you can define custom scalar types.
 *
 * * An exclamation point (!) after a declared field's type means "this field's value can never be null."
 *
 * * It's good practice for a mutation to return whatever objects it modifies so the requesting client can update its
 * * cache and UI without needing to make a followup query.
